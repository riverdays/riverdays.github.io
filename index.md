## Kindra Kanna

### Background

Kindra is a serpentine sea dragon in the shape of a raen Au Ra, through the use of an Allagan choker. She woke after her containment unit in Azys Lla fell hundreds of yalms to the ground and tore open. She was found and raised by the raen of the Ruby Sea, in an exceptional stroke of coincidence. Unaware of her own origins at first, she grew accustomed to her Au Ra shape during many years of traveling and self-discovery.

It was not until she met Midgardsormr that she realized her true dragon nature, but she never sprang from a brood. She was artificially born through Allagan cloning technology. She suspects her DNA may be descended from one of Ratatoskr's offspring, but there's no way to know for sure anymore. She accepts this as a sign to embrace her identity as an Au Ra, and stubbornly refuses to return to her full dragon form, preferring to keep the Allagan collar on at all times.

In typical fashion, most dragons seem to have at least one thing they're staunchly stubborn about.

When she isn't risking her tail dungeoning or adventuring, she enjoys spending time with friends and fatemily. :)

### Gender/Sexuality

Dragons do not perceive "male or female" in the traditional sense. Kindra chooses she/her as a preference from growing up with Au Ra people and enjoying her role as shrine maiden and caretaker during her years there.

Kindra is aromantic, having never been interested in romantic relationships.

She does have strong feelings of familial love and bonds of friendship.

### Allagan Mystery

Thanks to Kindra's fascination with translating Allagan technology, she learned that her choker contains information about herself.

Kindra gathers that she is the clone of a long deceased dragon from the third astral era.

While Kindra does not know her own age, she can assume from this that she is not ancient but was born relatively recently in that Allagan test tube. The automated system appears to have malfunctioned, or was damaged by experimental intervention.
